- [Ant Design Charts Gallery](https://charts.ant.design/demos/global/)

## Todo ‚úîÔ∏è

- enable ssl
- Draw out models and their relationships (user, charge, purchase, etc.) so you can finalize the models
- Line chart needs to have points on liner to hover over and give information like description (similar to njcoronavirus.com)
- Change attribute date to recurring_date for Charge model
- Seeing if I went past my budget
  - Predicts how much you‚Äôll make based off of how much you‚Äôre making (can predict for the next month, 2 months, it‚Äôs configurable)
- Seeing in what categories I spent the most
- Put in items you want to purchase for the month and see if it crosses budget
- how will i visualize the payments
- enable sign in/sign out func
  - this will entail us to save user data (when we'll start needing to work on backend)
